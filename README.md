## Purpose:
We were contracted to analyze weather data in Hawaii to determine the viability of a Surf and Ice Cream shop can be viable as a year round business, as opposed to a summertime seasonal business. Using data collected year round on temperatures 

## Results

Upon analyzing the results, I believe it shows that the temperature is similar enough from one season to the other that year round operation is feasable. 

- the average temperatures for both months are within three degrees of each other. Both have an average temperature above 70 degrees. This is ideal since demand should be fairly consistent across both months. 

-A difference between the two months is that the spread of temperatures is much wider in December. The vast majority of days still have a temperature between 60 and 80 degrees, but there are some outliers that drop as low as 56 degrees. Colder days will likely show lower demand. 

## summary

Overall, the data shows that while temperatures do skew higher in June than in December, the overall temperatures are fairly consistent and warm enough to support the business all year long.

Future investigation could provide further data by looking at a couple other details of weather data. I believe relevant data to analyze are rainfall and wind, both of which will affect the likelihood of people wanting to go out on the waves. High wind days willl have more chaotic waves, which will affect who wants to go on the waves and days where there is high rainfall will have lower demand for both ice cream and surfing.
